# Learning Apache Pekko with Practical Exercises

Welcome to the educational repository dedicated to **Apache Pekko**!  
This guide will take you step by step through learning Pekko, the framework for **concurrent and distributed programming** in Scala, through a series of practical exercises with increasing difficulty.

---

## Repository Contents

- **Basic Exercises**: fundamental concepts, actors, messages.
- **Intermediate Exercises**: state management, supervision, actor communication.
- **Advanced Exercises**: chatroom, clustering, integration with external systems.

Each exercise includes:
- Example code.
- Detailed explanation.

---

## Prerequisites

- **sbt** (Scala Build Tool)
- Scala-compatible IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended)
- Basic knowledge of **functional programming** and **concurrency**

---

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alessandro-Castelli/ToLearnPekko.git
   cd repository-pekko
2. Start sbt
3. Compile the project
4. Run the exercise

## Practical Tips
- Test each exercise individually before moving to the next.
- Experiment by modifying the behavior of actors.
- Study supervision patterns and error management.
- Try scaling the project with more actors and cluster nodes.

## 📈 Expansion Proposal

> This repository can be enriched by adding more complex exercises to deepen skills in Apache Pekko.  
> **Methodical Suggestions:**
> 
> 1. **Gradual Increase in Complexity:**  
>    Each new exercise should build on previously learned concepts, adding a logical step of difficulty (e.g., from local state to persistence, then to clustering).
> 
> 2. **Real-world Problems:**  
>    Include realistic scenarios, such as distributed chatrooms, messaging systems, or integration with Kafka/HTTP.
> 
> 3. **Commented Solutions:**  
>    Each advanced exercise should provide a detailed solution explaining design choices, supervision strategies, and concurrency implications.
> 
> 4. **Testing and Debugging:**  
>    Add exercises that teach systematic testing and debugging of actor-based systems.
> 
> 5. **Progressive Documentation:**  
>    Update the README and code comments to guide the user step by step through advanced exercises.
> 
> Following this method, you can build a solid and clear learning curve, leading from basic Pekko usage to complex and professional scenarios.
